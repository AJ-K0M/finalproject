This web application is a simple platform that allows users to create and manage their own blogs. Users can register for an account, log in, and access a dashboard where they can view, edit, delete, or create new posts. Each post includes a title, content, author, and the date it was created. On the homepage, published posts are displayed in reverse chronological order for everyone to see. The application also supports multiple users, with their credentials stored in a "users" table in the database. Posts are stored in a "posts" table, which tracks the title, content, author ID, creation date, and whether the post is published or not. This setup ensures a smooth and organized way for users to manage their blog content.
